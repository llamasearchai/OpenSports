# Best Practices for Using the OpenInsight Experiment Service

This guide outlines best practices for implementing and running experiments with the OpenInsight Experiment Service in production environments.

## Experiment Design

### Planning Your Experiments

1. **Start with clear hypotheses**: Define what you want to test and what success looks like before creating an experiment.
   ```
   Good: "Green buttons will increase sign-up conversion rates by at least 10%"
   Bad: "Let's see which button color performs better"
   ```

2. **Test one variable at a time**: Avoid changing multiple elements in a single variant, as it makes it hard to determine what caused any difference in performance.

3. **Use meaningful variant names**: Name variants with descriptive labels that clearly indicate what is being tested.
   ```
   Good: "Green CTA Button"
   Bad: "Variant B"
   ```

4. **Define appropriate sample sizes**: Use power analysis to determine how many visitors you need for statistical significance.

5. **Consider segmentation**: Plan how you'll analyze results across different user segments (new vs. returning, mobile vs. desktop, etc.).

### Setting Up Experiments

1. **Always include a control variant**: The first variant should be your current implementation as a baseline.

2. **Start with A/B testing**: Use simple A/B tests before moving to more complex multi-armed bandit experiments.

3. **Use traffic allocation wisely**: For high-risk changes, start with a small percentage of traffic (e.g., 10%) and increase gradually.

4. **Choose the right experiment type**:
   - **A/B Test**: For clear hypothesis testing and understanding causality
   - **Multi-Armed Bandit**: For optimizing ongoing conversion rates while testing
   - **Interleaving**: For comparing ranking or recommendation algorithms

## Implementation

### Code Integration

1. **Create fallbacks**: Always have a default experience ready in case the experiment service fails.

   ```python
   try:
       variant = manager.get_variant_for_user(experiment_id, user_id)
       button_color = variant["name"] if variant else "blue"  # blue is default
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Experiment service error: {str(e)}")
       button_color = "blue"  # fallback to default
   ```

2. **Make user assignment idempotent**: Ensure users always get the same variant, even across sessions.

3. **Cache variant assignments**: For high-traffic applications, consider caching variant assignments to reduce load.

   ```python
   # Using a simple in-memory cache with timeout
   variant_cache = {}
   
   def get_cached_variant(experiment_id, user_id, timeout_seconds=300):
       cache_key = f"{experiment_id}:{user_id}"
       cached = variant_cache.get(cache_key)
       
       if cached and (time.time() - cached["timestamp"] < timeout_seconds):
           return cached["variant"]
       
       # Get fresh variant
       variant = manager.get_variant_for_user(experiment_id, user_id)
       
       # Update cache
       variant_cache[cache_key] = {
           "variant": variant,
           "timestamp": time.time()
       }
       
       return variant
   ```

4. **Implement proper error handling**: Log errors from the experiment service but don't let them break your application.

5. **Measure experiment performance impact**: Monitor any performance degradation when adding experiments, particularly for user-facing code.

### Data Collection

1. **Record impressions accurately**: Ensure impressions are only counted when the variant is actually shown to the user.

2. **Track conversions at the right points**: Place conversion tracking at the exact point where the desired action is completed.

3. **Use consistent user identifiers**: Use the same user ID across your entire application.

4. **Include conversion values when relevant**: For revenue-based experiments, always include the monetary value of conversions.

5. **Consider implementing server-side tracking**: Client-side tracking can be blocked by ad blockers.

## Running Experiments

### Monitoring

1. **Check experiment health regularly**: Verify that impressions and conversions are being recorded as expected.

2. **Set up alerts for anomalies**: Create alerts for sudden drops in conversion rates or other unexpected results.

3. **Monitor for sample ratio mismatch**: Ensure variants are receiving traffic in the expected proportions.

4. **Track experiment coverage**: Monitor what percentage of users are included in at least one experiment.

### Analysis

1. **Wait for statistical significance**: Don't make decisions until you have enough data for reliable results.

2. **Look beyond the overall results**: Analyze performance across different segments and time periods.

3. **Consider practical significance**: A statistically significant result might still be too small to justify implementation.

4. **Beware of multiple testing**: When running many experiments or analyzing many segments, adjust your significance thresholds.

5. **Document learnings**: Record what you learned from each experiment, even if the results were negative.

## Operational Considerations

### Experiment Lifecycle

1. **Set a predefined duration**: Decide in advance how long the experiment will run.

2. **End experiments promptly**: Once you've made a decision, end the experiment to reduce complexity.

3. **Implement winners systematically**: Have a clear process for implementing winning variants permanently.

4. **Archive experiment results**: Keep a record of all experiments and their results for future reference.

### Technical Management

1. **Manage experiment IDs carefully**: Store experiment IDs in configuration rather than hardcoding them.

2. **Periodically clean up old experiments**: Delete or archive experiments that are no longer needed.

3. **Monitor system load**: Watch for any performance impact from running multiple experiments.

4. **Set up redundancy**: For mission-critical experiments, consider setting up redundant experiment services.

5. **Back up experiment data**: Regularly back up experiment configurations and results.

## Organizational Best Practices

1. **Document hypotheses and decisions**: Keep a record of why each experiment was run and what decision was made.

2. **Share results widely**: Make experiment results accessible to relevant stakeholders.

3. **Create a learning cycle**: Use learnings from past experiments to inform future experiments.

4. **Establish an experimentation calendar**: Coordinate experiments to avoid conflicts and ensure proper sequencing.

5. **Build an experimentation culture**: Encourage team members to propose experiments and share insights.

## Summary

Effective experimentation with the OpenInsight Experiment Service requires careful planning, implementation, monitoring, and analysis. By following these best practices, you can maximize the value of your experiments and make more informed decisions based on real user data.
